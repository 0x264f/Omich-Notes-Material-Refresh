<br>_**Fork of the Omich Notes app with Material Design.**_<br/> The development of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omichsoft.notes">original</a> application was stopped 4 years ago and the source code was not released. This repository contains the modifications that I made over the application and the binary packages that I builded for myself.
